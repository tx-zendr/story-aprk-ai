    "Barry stared at his phone, heart thrumming against his ribs. \u2018It\u2019s coming. Be prepared. The whole thing will be over by 8.\u2019 A cryptic message, clearly a dire warning. He pictured asteroids, shadowy government operatives, or perhaps a rogue sentient toaster uprising. He\u2019d barely managed to bolt the cat flap before 7:55.\n\nHe huddled under the kitchen table, a half-eaten bag of emergency crisps clutched tight. What kind of 'thing'? Global economic collapse? An unexpected visit from his Aunt Mildred? The latter felt equally catastrophic. The clock ticked. Every shadow seemed sinister, every creak a prelude to doom.\n\nThen, at exactly 8:00, a loud *THUD* echoed from his front door. Barry yelped, spilling crisps. This was it! The end!\n\nHe peeked out, trembling. His sister, Brenda, stood there, wrestling a colossal, glitter-dusted birthday cake through the doorway. \"Finally!\" she puffed. \"Sorry for the cryptic text, Barry, but I needed you out of the kitchen while I iced this monster. Happy 40th! The whole *surprise* thing is over now.\"\n\nBarry stared at the cake, then at his phone, then back at the cake. His carefully barricaded home suddenly felt very silly."

  "my friend is a Trader": [
    "The aroma was... earthy, with a curious metallic whisper. As a new arrival to the Grimshaw family\u2019s notorious \u201cremembrance feasts,\u201d I clutched my sherry, a nervous smile fixed. The other guests, a motley collection of ghoulish gourmands, were already tucking in, their laughter echoing a little too loudly in the velvet-draped hall.\n\n\"Just a sliver, dearie?\" Widow Grimshaw purred, holding a silver platter laden with something dark, glistening. \"He always loved a good roast. So tender.\"\n\nA man with a monocle chewed thoughtfully. \"The texture is divine. And the subtle hint of... old spice? Exquisite!\" He winked at me.\n\nI managed a strained smile, politely declining. The chattering around me was of inheritance battles and peculiar last wishes, all punctuated by the clinking of cutlery. \"He left everything to his cats, you know,\" someone whispered, dabbing their lips. \"The ingrate!\"\n\nMy chest felt strangely hollow. Grimshaw approached, offering a perfectly browned knuckle. \"Don't worry, dear,\" she murmured, a knowing glint in her eye. \"We\u2019re all guests here tonight. And you,\" she added, pushing the platter closer, \"were always the *life* of the party.\" I stared at the platter, then at my own ghostly, translucent hand. The knuckle was remarkably familiar."
